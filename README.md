# Goal Oriented Action Planning AI
 GOAP Implemented with backwards BFS

Goal Oriented Acion planning implemented in conjunction with Minimum communication policy for collision avoidance.
The algorithm is not complete and sub-optimal.

Collisions can be noticed when two ships have the same goal however the ships will stop to give way to another ship that is closest to its location.


Each ship has an unoptimized implementation of A* algorithm. This can be improved by a binary heap implementation to get the minimum node.
